# Task-Manager
 This is Task Manager, a web application designed to help users efficiently manage their tasks and boost productivity. This repository contains the source code for the Task Manager application.
 The application employs MongoDB as the backend database to store and manage task data and utilizes Express.js to implement RESTful APIs.
 The goal of this project is to build a task management system that allows users to efficiently organize their tasks and improve their productivity.

## Features
- Task Creation, Editing, and Deletion:
  Users will be able to create new tasks, edit existing ones, and delete completed or outdated tasks. 
- User-friendly Interface:
  I intend to create an intuitive and user-friendly interface for Task Manager. A clean and straightforward design will make it easy for users to navigate the application and manage their tasks seamlessly.
